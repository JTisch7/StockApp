This is a machine learning-backed application aimed at providing the user access to trained machine learning models. This application was built using the Flask framework, runs on a Waitress WSGI server, and is hosted on Heroku. It uses a PostgreSQL database which is automatically updated with new data whenever the site is visited. The machine learning models were trained using SciKit-Learn on two years of thirty minute price data. The API is accessible and allows requests for stock price data and model predictions.
